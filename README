== Description
   A library for creating and verifying so-called »hash cash stamps«, i.e.
   proof of work as defined on hashcash.org.

== Prerequisites
   This package requires Ruby 1.8 or later.

== Installation instructions
   rake test (optional)
   rake install (non-gem) or rake install_gem (gem)

== Synopsis
   require 'hashcash'

   # Create a new hash cash stamp
   s = HashCash::Stamp.new(:resource => 'hashcash@alech.de')
   puts s

   # Verify a given stamp
   s = HashCash::Stamp.new(:stamp => '1:20:060408:adam@cypherspace.org::1QTjaYd7niiQA/sc:ePa')
   s.verify('adam@cypherspace.org)

== Known bugs
   Stamp creation is an order of magnitude slower than using the
   standalone hash cash program. This might not be fixed as I
   mainly use the library for verification.
